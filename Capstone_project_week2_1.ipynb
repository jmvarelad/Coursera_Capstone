I will use several variables, like the weather conditions, road conditions or light conditions, to find the severity of the accidents. With this in mind, I will build a prediction model, in order to evaluate the severity of future accidents, so the drivers can evaluate if it is necessary to change their driving style (for example, slow down if it is raining or have special precaution in front of particular traffic circumstances)."
